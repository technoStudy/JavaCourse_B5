                    Array VS ArrayList

        - Array is a fixed-length data structure, so we can't change length of Array
          once created. ArrayList is resizable (Dynamic Array)

        - Array can contain both primitives and objects
          ArrayList can only store Objects

        - Also we can compare Array and ArrayList on how to calculate length of
          Array or size of ArrayList
          We use length() method for arrays, size() method for ArrayList
